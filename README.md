# AwESome Password Manager 2.0

### !!! Now with a GUI !!!

## What it is now
The Command-Line part has not changed too much. 

I've just made some adjustments to the functions and also several optimization, also I have discovered PEP8 Compliance so the code will be soon PEP8 compliant.  

The GUI is very easy-to-use and it has all the features of the CLI.  

OAuth Authentication turned to be more difficult than I tought due to problems with Google trusting my application, but maybe I will find a workaround. ;)

Thank you for reading this far, below you can find all the infos about the program, this space is (for the moment) intended as a journal or changelog or maybe just a what-am-I-learning-and-doing-about-code-diary.

See you at 3.0!

## Requirements

* Cryptography module, a very popular library for Cryptography.
* PySimpleGui module, a very popular library for creating powerful GUI interfaces.

You can install them via:
```
pip install cryptography
pip install pysimplegui
```

## Features

### New Features
* **PySimpleGui** based **GUI**

### Old Features
* **Two-Level Encryption** : First Custom Made, Second AES-Based
* **Full Modularity** : Swap all the components (Access Keys, Dictionaries and Databases)
                         with just a command.                 
* **Easy to use** : (and still fashionable) :red_circle::yellow_circle::large_blue_circle: colorful :red_circle::yellow_circle::large_blue_circle: command-line interface.
* **No installation needed**, just run it with Python 3.8> on your Terminal/Prompt.
* **Multi Language** : Currently Italian and English are supported but several languages can be easily added.
* **Fully Open-Source**

## Currently Working on
- [ ] OAuth Authentication For GDrive Upload Functionality (more services are gonna be covered too)
- [ ] Having new new ideas
- [ ] Bug Catching and fixing
- [ ] PEP8 Compliance
- [ ] Secure notes
- [ ] Rewriting CLI with Click
- [x] External dictionaries implementation
- [x] Swappable Graphic Interface using ~~tkinter~~ PySimpleGui



####
If you encounter any **bug** or whatever that could be in the wrong place I would be
very thankful if you spend a minute letting me know. I am always trying to learn
more and more of this cool language.
