## What it is
This is one of my first projects in Python.
Is a **password manager** that uses **Cryptography** library and a command-line interface
to help you manage your **passwords**.

## Requirements

* Cryptography module, a very popular library for Cryptography.
You can install it via:
```
pip install cryptography
```


## Features
* **Two-Level Encryption** : First Custom Made, Second AES-Based
* **Full Modularity** : Swap all the components (Access Keys, Dictionaries and Databases)
                         with just a command.                 
* **Easy to use** : (and still fashionable) :red_circle::yellow_circle::large_blue_circle: colorful :red_circle::yellow_circle::large_blue_circle: command-line interface.
* **No installation needed**, just run it with Python 3.8> on your Terminal/Prompt.
* **Multi Language** : Currently Italian and English are supported but several languages can be easily added.

If you encounter any **bug** or whatever that could be in the wrong place I would be
very thankful if you spend a minute letting me know. I am always trying to learn
more and more of this cool language.
